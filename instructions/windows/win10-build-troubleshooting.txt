First errors about plugins - Followed instructions provided about maven plugins:
In case of failures related to maven plugins run:
   cd hadoop-maven-plugins
   mvn install

Concerning / Similar to: error MSB4019: The imported project "C:\Microsoft.Cpp.Default.props" was not found.
Fix:
-Launch regedit
-Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSBuild\4.0 
-On default set value data to path of Microsoft.Cpp.Default.props eg: C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft.Cpp\v4.0\V140

Cmake Error: no cmake_c_compiler could be found / no cmake_cxx_compiler could be found
Fix:
Enable cmake VS 2015 project generation for hdfs
On the line 441 of \hadoop-hdfs-project\hadoop-hdfs\pom.xml, edit the else value as the following:

<condition property="generator" value="Visual Studio 10" else="Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64">

(the "value" value applies to win32 - you may want to edit it if building for win32).

Probably the next error after you do this is the following:
CMake Error: Error: generator : Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64[exec] Does not match the generator used 
	previously: Visual Studio 10 2010 Win64[exec] Either remove the CMakeCache.txt file and CMakeFiles 
	directory or choose a different binary directory.
Fix:
Remove CMakeCache.txt and also remove CMakeFiles directory.
